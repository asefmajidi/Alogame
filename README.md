# Alogame
What I tried: I tried downloading the applications including the Unity Hub, and Github Desktop but for the Alogame project, I did not use Github Desktop, I cloned the project and uploaded the project into the Unity Hub. In the Unity Hub while starting the game, I changed the aspect ratio to 4 and 3 
What I learned: Even though my Unity Hub was acting weired and I had to restart it often, I was able to explore the game, the navigation where we work through the functions to take the person to the top left corner. 
What questions I have about the project: I was wondering what is the purpose of the project, other than that not any questions really. 
What I would propose to do in order to make the game easier:A We can saperate the functions into different catagories. And when we use multiple functions, if there was a functions that we could just delete all the functions which we used and move them to trash at once instead of deleting them one by one.
